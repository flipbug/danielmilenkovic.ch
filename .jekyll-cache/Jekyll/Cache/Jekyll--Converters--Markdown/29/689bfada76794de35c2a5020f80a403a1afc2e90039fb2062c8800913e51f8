I"¡<p>I rediscovered my passion for art in the end of 2020. I was quite involved creating art of various kinds in my mid teens, ranging from pencil drawings to 3D. But as life progressed further I put my focus on other things and didnâ€™t really do anything drawing related for over ten years. As 2020 happened, it really forced me as many others to slow down and gave me the opportunity to reevaluate my life.</p>

<p>I noticed how I used to be busy all the time doing stuff I didnâ€™t really want to do, if I was being honest with myself. I was just too distracted to notice it any time sooner. This realization led me to drop a few hobbies, dial back on social activities and question my current career. This of course didnâ€™t happen all at the same time, but rather as a process over a couple of months.</p>

<p>Interestingly as soon as a I let go and gave myself room to breath old passions started to rise up. I started to feel the urge to start drawing again and hop on a skateboard. Skateboarding was another passion in my teens, which I lost over time. In a sense I feel like I am connecting with my younger self again. Dropping the weight which has accumulated over time.</p>

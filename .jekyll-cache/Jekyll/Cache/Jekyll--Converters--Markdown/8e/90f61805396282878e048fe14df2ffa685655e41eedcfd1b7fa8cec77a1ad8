I"‡<p>I recently got very frustrated while drawing. The drawing is based on a mental image and I want to turn it into a fully finished piece. This means Iâ€™ve already set the expectations rather high and during the drawing process felt like I couldnâ€™t meet these expectations. This led to an endless cycle of making changes, being frustrated with these changes and making new changes. In hindsight it is obvious that I was being too harsh with myself.</p>

<p>I was attempting a drawing containing subjects I have never really drawn before. A black panther and a man in a new pose. So why did I expect to get a perfect result on my first try?</p>

I"Ð<p>I recently got very frustrated while drawing. The drawing is based on a mental image with the intention to turn it into a fully finished piece. So Iâ€™ve already set the expectations quite high, but during the drawing process I felt like I couldnâ€™t meet these expectations. This led to an endless cycle of making changes, being frustrated with these changes and making even more changes. In hindsight it is obvious that I was being too harsh with myself.</p>

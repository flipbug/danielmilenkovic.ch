I"<p>I rediscovered my passion for art in the end of 2020. I was quite involved creating art of various kinds in my mid teens, ranging from pencil drawings to 3D. But as life progressed further I put my focus on other things and didn’t really do anything drawing related for over ten years. As 2020 happened, it really forced me as many others to slow down and gave me the opportunity to reevaluate my life.</p>

<p>I noticed how I used to be busy all the time doing stuff I didn’t really want to do, if I was being honest with myself. I was just too distracted to notice it any time sooner. This realization led me to drop a few hobbies, dial back on social activities and question my current career. This of course didn’t happen all at the same time, but rather as a process over a couple of months.</p>

<p>Interestingly as soon as a I let go and gave myself room to breath old passions started to rise up. I started to feel the urge to start drawing again and hop on a skateboard. Skateboarding was another passion in my teens, which I lost over time. In a sense I feel like I am connecting with my younger self again. Dropping the weight which has accumulated over time. I find it very curious that we are often not even aware over our true needs and thus start adapting external beliefs until we forget who we actually are. Doing things for others approval, instead of doing what is in our own best interest. Recognising this pattern has helped me to take a step back and take life back into my own hands.</p>

<p>Drawing for me is a way to quiet my monkey mind and express myself. It is also a great way for me to accept failure and to grow from it. Since I still consider myself a beginner, it can be frustrating at times, if a drawing is not working out as expected or if something just doesn’t seem to look right. Through this process I realised how brutal I sometimes am with myself and how being kinder to myself has had an effect on my overall well being.</p>

<p>So follow along on my journey into the world of art and the human condition.</p>

I"Š<p>I recently got very frustrated while drawing. The drawing is based on a mental image and I want to turn it into a fully finished piece. This means Iâ€™ve already set the expectations rather high and during the drawing process felt like I couldnâ€™t meet these expectations. This led to an endless cycle of making changes, being frustrated with these changes and making new changes. In hindsight it is obvious that I was being too harsh with myself.</p>

<p>I was attempting a drawing containing subjects I have never really drawn before. So why did I expect to get a perfect result on my first try? Of course every drawing has parts that I havenâ€™t really drawn before, but there is a difference in things that are new but similar or completely new. I guess after drawing for years everything gets kinda similar, since the basic shapes are all the same, but I am not there yet.</p>

<p>Being kinder to myself and accepting failure as part of the learning process 
 helps growing as an artist (or practitioner of any kind). Beating yourself up only introduces even more pain. I realize that writing this is easy, but actually acting upon the advice is something completely different. I accept that frustrations will arise in the future. But instead of falling into a downward spiral, I can use the frustration as a guide. It means something is not working as expected and that there is potential for learning.</p>

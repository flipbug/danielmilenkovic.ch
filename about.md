        <p>Hi, my name is Daniel Milenkovic, currently based in Winterthur, Switzerland.</p>

        <p>I started this life in 1993 and from early on wished to become an architect. Plans change and during school I developed a proficiency for code, which led me into the world of programming and obtaining a <a href="https://ba-pub.engineering.zhaw.ch/BA_WebPublication/Flyer.pdf?version=Bachelorarbeit2019&code=BA19_wele_04&language=de" target="_blank"> bachelor's degree in Computer Science</a>.</p>

        <p>My programming career has led me through the following places so far, before deciding to go freelance:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>2011 - 2011 Internship at <a href="https://strichpunkt.ch" target="_blank">Strichpunkt</a></li>
            <li>2012 - 2015 Web Developer at <a href="https://snowflake.ch" target="_blank">Snowflake</a></li>
            <li>2015 - 2016 Web Developer at <a href="https://notch-interactive.com" target="_blank">Notch Interactive</a></li>
            <li>2016 - 2017 Python/Django Developer at <a href="https://curve-interactions.com" target="_blank">Curve Interactions</a></li>
            <li>2017 - 2022 Software Engineer at <a href="https://digitec.ch" target="_blank">Digitec Galaxus</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Near the end of 2020 <a href="/blog/2021/09/10/learning-to-draw">I rediscovered my passion for art</a>, which ultimately led to the decision to leave classical employment and be more flexible with my time. I'm painting mostly digitally using procreate, while developing my skills in more traditional oil and gouache painting.</p>

        <p>Besides art and programming my interests range from mythology to skateboarding and especially reading comics.</p>

        <p>Feel free to contact me directly via <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> or via <a href="https://instagram.com/danielmilenkovic.art" target="_blank">instagram</a>. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.</p>

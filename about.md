Hi, my name is Daniel Milenkovic. 

I was born in switzerland in 1993. After finishing school I started to work as a web developer, while doing a Bachelor's in Computer Science. Currently I work part-time as a software engineer.

I created this blog to share what inspires me and to reflect on my thoughts. Feel free to contact my via [email](mailto:danielmilenkovic@protonmail.com) or via [instagram](https://instagram.com/flipbug). I'm looking forward to hear from you.

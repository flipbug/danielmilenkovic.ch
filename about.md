<p>Hi, my name is Daniel Milenkovic. I am a freelance illustrator based in Winterthur, Switzerland.</p>

<p>I was born in switzerland in 1993. After finishing school I started to work as a web developer, while doing a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I've worked as a Software Engineer for roughly 10 years before deciding to transition into a career in illustration. My interests range from mythology to skateboarding and I love reading comics.</p>

<p>I created this blog to share what inspires me and to reflect on my thoughts. Feel free to contact my via <a href="mailto:danielmilenkovic@protonmail.com">email</a> or via <a href="https://instagram.com/danielmilenkovic.art" target="_blank">instagram</a>. I'm looking forward to hear from you.</p>
